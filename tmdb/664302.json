  "overview": "Born from the internet, the phrase \"TFW No GF\" was originally used online to describe a lack of romantic companionship. Since then, it has evolved to symbolize a greater state of existence defined by isolation, rejection and alienation.  The meme's protagonist, \"WOJAK,\" has become the mascot to a vast online community consisting of self-described \"hyper-anonymous twenty somethings\" and \"guys who slipped between the cracks.\"  TFW No GF asks: How has the zeitgeist come to bear down on a generation alienated by the 'real world'? Meet the lost boys who came of age on the internet- places like 4chan and Twitter, where they find camaraderie in despair.",
