  "overview": "Two queer friends go out to enjoy the nightlife in Volta Redonda, an industrial city where the night has an air of mystery and despair. Despite the filth, noise and pollution emitted by the steel industry, located in the center of the city, the two friends show that it is possible to live their LQBTQIAPN+ existences, even in a marginalized way, since their bodies are only allowed to inhabit the night of the city they name like \"Gotham\".",
