  "overview": "Michael lives in two separate realities after a car accident. In one reality, his wife Hannah survives the accident; in the other reality, his son Rex survives. Michael does not know which reality is \"real\", and uses the wristbands to differentiate the two. He sees two therapists: Dr. Jonathan Lee in the \"red reality\" and Dr. Judith Evans in the \"green reality\". At work, Michael's erratic behavior triggers clashes with his team; they do not know about Michael's uncanny ability to solve crimes using details from both realities.",
