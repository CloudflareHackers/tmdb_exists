  "overview": "An orphaned woman named Bharati builds a family with her husband and two sons, but her life is shattered by a series of tragedies. After her husband dies in an accident, she is left homeless and must raise her children alone. With the help of a kind stranger, she works tirelessly to give her sons a good life, only to be betrayed and abandoned by them, leaving her back on the streets.  Refusing to give up, Bharati starts over and builds a small food business into a five-star hotel empire. Years later, her now-destitute sons return to claim her fortune. When she refuses to acknowledge them, they take her to court and hire a sharpshooter to kill her. In a dramatic courtroom climax, Bharati's powerful testimony moves the killer, who turns his gun on her sons instead.",
