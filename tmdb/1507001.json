  "overview": "WALL-E is an animated sci-fi movie set in a distant future where Earth is abandoned and covered in trash. The last working robot, WALL-E, spends his days cleaning up the planet and collecting interesting items. One day, a robot named EVE arrives to search for signs of life. WALL-E falls in love with her and shows her a small plant he found, proof that Earth can support life again. When EVE is taken back to a spaceship where humans now live, WALL-E follows her. Onboard, they discover humans have become lazy and reliant on machines. Together, WALL-E and EVE help the humans realize the importance of caring for their planet and inspire them to return to Earth and rebuild. The film uses minimal dialogue, focusing on visual storytelling and themes of love, hope, and environmental responsibility.",
