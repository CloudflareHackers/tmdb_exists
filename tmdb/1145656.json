  "overview": "A humorous look at the day in the life of two women. A man embarks on a journey, his destination a woman living in a tower block on the other side of town. Naked begins with his departure and ends with his arrival at the close of the day. Following him on his journey is a mythical window cleaner, whose flying gantry takes us through the city to a tower block where he spies on a woman preparing for her guest and observes her neurotic next-door neighbours. Naked, which refers to the women’s vulnerability as well as their state of undress, uses model, drawn and photo animation within three dimensional sets.",
