  "overview": "Located in the backwaters of a dam, Sita Parvata is an island slowly submerging due to the rains. The government succeeds in evacuating the residents by giving them compensation for the properties they own. The village temple priest Duggajja, his son Ganapa, and his daughter-in-law Nagi find it impossible to leave their homeland and make a living with the meager compensation given by the government. On the island, they are important people, but outside, they would be one among hundreds of families struggling to make a living. The film narrates the struggles of the family and how ultimately in the end they manage to continue life on the island.",
