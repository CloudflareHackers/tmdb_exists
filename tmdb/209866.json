  "overview": "Helsinki in the summer is shown differently through the eyes of the homicide unit detectives, Timo Harjunpää and Onerva Nykänen; painting a picture of the city where people are not safe in the streets or not even in their own homes. In the midst of the hard crimes it is impossible not to feel the constant worry about your own family while being afraid of losing touch with your children.",
