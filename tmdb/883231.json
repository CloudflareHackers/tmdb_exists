  "overview": "NAK-ED is a documentary with the intention of breaking the norms around nudity in order to decrease body shaming. In NAK-ED you’ll meet people from around the world with different approaches and thoughts about nudity. Some show us what shame about our naked bodies does to us, while others challenge conventions and want to change the world. NAK-ED tests society’s boundaries as well as director Jan Dalchow’s own nudity limits. – From when I was very young I’ve struggled with shame about my body, shame about my nudity and shame about my sexuality, says Jan Dalchow who lives in Norway with his husband.",
