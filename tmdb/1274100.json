  "overview": "They seem to know each other like the back of their hands. Yet, there is something awkward about their relationship. Nikita finds even the most innocent of touches by Neeraj to be so repulsive. Aniket, her colleague, has proposed to her and she is seriously considering it. Yet, she can’t let go of Neeraj.  Why does she seem stuck between a rock and a hard place? What’s the matter with Neeraj? Is it some deficiency, disability or a disease? It would need a silver bullet to get them together. What if the silver bullet already exists, unknown to them?",
