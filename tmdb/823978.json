  "overview": "In this rendition of John Cage’s score 4’33” from 1952, the musician Aérea Negrot remains silent in front of several microphones installed on Oranienplatz, the site of a refugee protest camp in 2012. This performative gesture points to a precarious distinction between the violence of being silenced and the powerful agency of refusal.",
