  "overview": "In the high-octane world of IPL 2025, cricket isn’t just a game, it’s war without bullets. One team, Royal Challengers Bengaluru, has become an unstoppable force, steamrolling opponents with ruthless precision, controversial tactics, and a billionaire-backed playbook that blurs the line between sport and domination. With whispers of match-fixing, player poaching, and AI-driven strategies, RCB is no longer just a team, it’s a cricketing empire.  But the soul of the sport isn’t ready to surrender.  Nine rival teams, each with their own stars and struggles, forge uneasy alliances to preserve the spirit of the game. As underdogs rise and legends return, the battle for cricket’s heart ignites in a cinematic clash of loyalty, legacy, and rebellion.  Will RCB complete their reign of terror or will cricket fight back?",
