  "overview": "The film moves forward through the bumbling sibling rivalry set against a rustic backdrop, but it is more than just that. Sumesh (Sreenath Bhasi) and Ramesh (Balu Varghese) lead a rather happy-go-lucky life, playing cricket and hanging out with friends. But we see how the duo buries the hatchet and stands shoulder to shoulder when something important happens in the family,",
