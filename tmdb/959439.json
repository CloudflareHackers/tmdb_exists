  "overview": "Kisaragi Station is an urban legend about a fictional railway station in an alternate universe where people can end up by accident.  Folklore researcher Haruna Tsutsumi interviews Sumiko Hayama, who claims she visited Kisaragi Station in 2004 and managed to return. Hayama recounts her story: she ended up on a train platform on a seemingly abandoned village with five other victims: three hoodlums, a salaryman and a high school girl named Asuka. After narrowly escaping various supernatural threats they found a glowing portal, and Hayama ended up back in the real world alone – though seven years had passed, and it was 2011.  Haruna follows the same steps as Hayama and ends up at Kisaragi Station herself. She finds the same people Hayama met, unknowingly trapped in an endless time loop. Armed with the knowledge of the events that will happen, Haruna tries to help them to the exit.",
