  "overview": "Karunesh Talwar is his usual annoyed self in his second stand up special. The whole show is about the relationships he shares with his parents & girlfriend, an attempt at self-awareness & the fact that we’re all just modified versions of our parents. Written during the Covid lockdown and workshopped on Zoom shows, this special is different from any hour of comedy he’s come up with before.",
