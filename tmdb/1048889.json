Three years ago, the school was closed after a shootout between soldiers and communist rebels killed a teacher and a student. Then the pandemic came and the closure was prolonged. When only two students show up on the first day of classes, Araceli realizes that there is a lot of work ahead because most of the students dedicate their time to video games and to this, we must add the insecurity of the region.",
