  "overview": "When nearby construction disturbs a spiritual resting place, its disgruntled denizens do what any supernatural beings would do after a rude awakening: they terrorize the local school. And that means it’s up to a scruffy band of young ghostbusters to expel their satanic schoolmates before everyone gets sent to permanent detention! So join Satsuki, her crybaby brother, the resident class stud, the school nerd and \"physical researcher,\" a born-again beauty, and a resentful, demon-possessed cat in the funniest, scariest school you’ve ever enrolled in.",
