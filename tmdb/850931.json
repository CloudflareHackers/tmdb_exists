  "overview": "This visual and musical feast sets the table for rich conversations about identity, belonging, creative expression, cultural appreciation + appropriation, and the complex terrain between intent, impact, and personal responsibility. Through Kim Villagante's (aka Kimmortal) journey into the heart of who they are, and 'what they love' is doubtlessly unique, this story will deeply resonate with many 2nd generation immigrant youth. This short's candid portrayal of the push/pull between adolescent pressures to conform, and 'stand out' also offers widely relatable gems of wisdom that can help us all along the way.",
