  "overview": "It’s feels like a vision of a pilgrimage gone south. Desperately looking for the gate in the forgotten lands where only military planes dare to fy. By using gouache painting and their digital processing, animation artist Francesco Rosso imagines two monks rehearsing, fnding perfect pitch which fows through walls and fences, despite their layers. The impulse for this animation comes from an existing musical composition by Karl Saks who recorded Buddhist monks chanting while on a trip to China.",
