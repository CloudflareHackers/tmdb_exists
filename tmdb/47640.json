  "overview": "A veteran of the war in Iraq, and self-proclaimed American Patriot, becomes convinced that the federal government is setting him up as the fall guy in a soon-to-be terrorist attack on American soil ~ yet his reactions to the paranoia unmistakably parallel that of a would-be terrorist. At once controversial and definitive, vehemently proactive, and overwhelmingly relevant in a political climate charged with uncertainties, Person of Interest gives voice to a disenfranchised generation of soldiers, while bravely prodding at the seams of homegrown terrorism in the United States.",
