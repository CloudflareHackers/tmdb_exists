  "overview": "From Steve Bannon and the visionary team behind \"Clinton Cash\", this groundbreaking film will leave you on the edge of your seat. \"Government Gangsters,\" based on the best-selling book by Former Deputy Director of National Intelligence Kash Patel, pulls back the curtain on the sinister world of corrupt bureaucrats, government officials, and their media accomplices, as they conspired to bring down a sitting President, Donald J. Trump, and all those who support him. This explosive film uncovers the depths of deceit and manipulation they employ daily, betraying the very system they vowed to protect. \"Government Gangsters\" is not just a film-it's a revelation that will forever alter your perception of government. May we never need another film like this.",
