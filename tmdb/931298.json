  "overview": "This is Lara. She measures 1,70m, her feet are too long for her body. That's why she's always stumbling. Lara lives in a strange world where everyone has a curvy, caricatured posture, except for her. No one communicates, people look but don't see each other. One day, Lara meets Hugo, the first person she identifies with. They get to know each other through a simple glance.  To what extent does this contact between them change their beings?",
