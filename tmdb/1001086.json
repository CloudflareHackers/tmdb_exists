  "overview": "An experimental film that explores a story of forbidden love between two men. The visuals represent two parallel narratives, one of the comforts and safe space that engulfs the world of the two lovers, where their intimacy is secured and protected, and the other narrative shot entirely outdoors speaks of the battles and the challenges that they endure in order to keep their affair afloat.",
