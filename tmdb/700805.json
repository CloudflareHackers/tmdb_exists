  "overview": "Writes Shimizu: \"I used to work as a photographer hired by a website to promote NYC and the Hamptons nightlife. The promoters would hire the people I worked for to send me over to their party to take photos of the people there. I would go to 2-3 different clubs a night, 4 nights a week. The range in partygoers was pretty big. During my final few months with the company, I was mainly assigned to an after-party spot on Broadway called Pangaea. At Pangaea, I photographed Ice T, Sting, among others. The job, for the most part, was really fun. I drank so much Red Bull vodka.\"",
