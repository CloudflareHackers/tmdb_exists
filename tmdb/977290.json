  "overview": "Filmed through mist directly into the sun at dawn just after sunrise on a winters morning in 2018. The film is a reflection on light, duration and visual transformation. Filmed hand held in a continuous take at a constant aperture, trees very gradually appear out of the mist with their distorted long shadows typical of the first light of day. Unpredictable and chance elements were involved throughout the filming process.",
