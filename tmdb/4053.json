As the Darlings' reluctant personal lawyer,  Nick George has barely begun to discover the legal - and illegal - needs  of the family. Blackmail threats. Questionable deals. Illegitimate  children. Illicit affairs. It will take every trick he can think of to  keep them out of the tabloids - and out of jail. But if he can solve his  father's mysterious death, it might be worth the hassle. Enter a  seductive world of glamorous people, exclusive parties and delicious  intrigue.",
