  "overview": "In the bustling capital of Bianjing during the Northern Song Dynasty, Madam Li moves her family in search of better marriage prospects for her five beautiful but quirky daughters, whose love lives have long been her worry. Each daughter, though famous for her beauty and wit, comes with unique quirks: the eldest, Shou Hua, has no interest in remarrying after early widowhood; the third, Kang Ning, is fierce and headstrong; the fourth, Hao De, is well-meaning but blunt; and the youngest, Le Shan, is spoiled and selective.  Challenges abound as they face unexpected setbacks, including a cold reception from the already-married sister they came to visit. As the family reestablishes their business, they navigate a series of humorous and heartwarming misadventures, ultimately finding love and fulfilling their mother’s hopes in this lively tale of family and romance.",
