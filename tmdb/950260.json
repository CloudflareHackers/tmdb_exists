  "overview": "The story is about the conflict between a father who doesn't know to ride a cycle and his  son who wants to learn to ride a cycle resulting in an emotional roller enjoyable ride.  Maari, a 12 year pre-teen boy's trust with a cycle changes his life upside down when the  village sees its first cycle-on-rent shop. Incidentally, his father is taunted by the villagers  for not knowing to ride a cycle.  Denied money to take a cycle on rent, and clandestinely supported by his pampering  mother furthered up his learning cause, Maari gets money and in-turn the possession of  cycle to learn cycling.  The learning journey starts, and that one hour cycling session turns in to a day, fully  peppered with interesting events and run-ups with strangers. Until it is walled by  Maari's father.  This one day bridges the gap between father and son. The realisation blossoms.",
