  "overview": "Twenty years have passed since those two apartments in the heart of Mexico City were the battlefield of a war of the sexes between Ana, Carlos, Andrea, Miguel, Tomás and María. All that is left of those apartments are memories and the image of Tomás' dead body at the bottom of the elevator shaft. Their lives have changed, their families have grown and new and unexpected characters have come to unsettle their daily lives and trigger a chain of events that will make them realize that modesty has been replaced by public disclosure; sex is only an app away; but love...love is still something elusive that everyone in today's banal and chaotic world is seeking.",
