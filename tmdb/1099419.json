  "overview": "When a gorgeous young blonde stepped off the plane in sunny Los Angeles, nothing could have prepared for the wildly erotic rollercoaster ride that awaited her. Three very eligible bachelors are competing for a special place in young Dawn's heart, as well as other \"special places\" on this beautiful girl's body. One thing leads to another and soon, Dawn finds herself diving head first into a long, hot, sticky three-way romance that has her constantly jumping out of her clothes and into the beds of her new found lovers. The searing hot sexual rendezvous, the mind dizzying blowjobs, are almost too much to handle for this fresh-faced small town girl who will have some wild tales to tell when...and if...she ever goes home.",
