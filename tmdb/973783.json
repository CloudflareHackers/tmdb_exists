  "overview": "Sayantan Mukherjee’s Action stays true to its name. There’s enough dhishoom-dhishoom, enough drama, enough glam quotient… and enough action. When Raka (Barkha Sengupta), a hot, 20-something, gun-toting coal-mafia’s amorous advents are rejected by college-goer Akash (Om), she turns his life into a living hell. So, Akash, along with his family, flees Ranigunj in order to escape Raka’s wrath and joins a college in Kolkata under the alias of Rohit Roy. Here, he meets Rini (Megha Chakraborty) and romance blooms. But is Raka ready to let go off Akash so soon?",
