  "overview": "The High Frontier: The Untold Story of Gerard K. O'Neill tells the untold story of the life and influence of the late physicist and space colony pioneer Dr. Gerard K. O'Neill. In 1977, O'Neill wrote the book The High Frontier: Human Colonies in Space, which sparked an enormous grassroots movement to build Earth-like habitats in space in order to solve Earth's greatest crises. The film is told through \"Gerry's Kids\" as they affectionately call themselves; his peers, family, and the younger generation who followed that movement and are now leading the modern day space industry.",
