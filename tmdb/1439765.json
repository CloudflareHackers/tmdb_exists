  "overview": "\"Survive\" is a powerful anthem about resilience, growth, and the journey of breaking free from life's struggles. Through the metaphor of a butterfly, the song captures the emotional battle between feeling trapped and finding the strength to evolve and fly away.  It speaks to the pain of survival, the courage it takes to rise above challenges, and the hope that something better awaits. The butterfly’s flight symbolizes freedom, transformation, and the never-ending will to keep going, even when life feels heavy.  “Stay alive, survive, break free” — Survive is a reminder that no matter how hard life gets, there's always a reason to push forward and bloom",
