  "overview": "Hollie dressed in disguise as her best friend Ying Shu at a matchmaking blind date, in order to scare off the suitor. However, Hollie hadn't expected the other matchmaking party to be Timo, the new CEO of Hollie's company. Hollie behaved badly on the date to try to get Timo to reject her, but Timo decided to marry Hollie so as to avoid being forced into perpetual matchmaking by his grandpa. The real Ying Shu bumped into Alfred, Timo's best friend and PA, in a car park, and Timo realised that Hollie was in pretense all along, and dreamt up a business proposal Hollie couldn't refuse. At the same time, however, Hollie didn't want Timo to discover that she is in reality his company employee, so she could only use the fake name \"Mei Ling Suen\" and started on the pursuit of a double life. The whole plan could only go wrong.",
