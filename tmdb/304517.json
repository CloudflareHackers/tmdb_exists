Years later Shamsher is still king, and has a daughter, Sunita, who he wants to get married to Kunver Ranjit Narayan Singh of Kishanganj. Shamsher does not know that the Bada and Chhota Kumars are still alive, while Shakti was taken in by a tribe of gypsies, Amar lives with his palace nanny, Leela, and believes she is his mother. The two princes will meet soon, not as friends and brothers though, but as enemies.",
