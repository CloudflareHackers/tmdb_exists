  "overview": "In the interrogation room, Belial finally speaks. His voice is rough and heavy, revealing truths no one is ready for. He knows the man who tried to kill him and describes what he’s done in bone-chilling detail. There’s no shouting, just a calm so unsettling it feels worse than chaos. The detectives quickly understand this isn’t just another case. It’s something bigger, something that shakes their sense of what’s real. There’s real evil coming, and time is running out.",
