Incredibly, Pang, a tenth-year student from the lowest academically ranked class, passes the Gifted Program placement test. His entrance to the Gifted Program is filled with much confusion as he and his new friends begin to feel something strange about their new class isn't quite right. They come to learn that the Gifted Program was designed to awaken the \"potentials\" within them, potentials beyond those of ordinary humans. However, as these potentials are discovered, their use begins to expose unanticipated danger. Before long, their new abilities reveal a secret the school's officials were trying to keep hidden.",
