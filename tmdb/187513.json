  "overview": "Two families, two homes and too many secrets. The Hendersons are a textbook dysfunctional family: Jason is a money-hungry philanderer; Amanda is an inattentive alcoholic. And both are eagerly consuming whatever sordid sexual opportunities cross their paths. Then there's the kids: Suzanne is a fashion-model while Neal is halfheartedly following his father into a legal career. When the next-door neighbors - a sexy widow and her prudish daughter - arrive, it's only a matter of time before the curtain falls on this charade.",
