  "overview": "For the first time, Pete Young takes a risk - perhaps the only risk of his young life - when he applies for and lands his dream job as a batboy for the New York Empires. The problem is that his single mother, Lynne has no idea what he's up to. Until now, he's been the golden boy while his rebellious older sister, Betsy, has always been in the doghouse. Pete attends a strict Catholic high school where he hangs out with his best friend, Mike, who hopes to cash in on his friend's new position in life. On the job, Pete becomes a member of a new family that includes Conrad Dean, the team's captain and star third baseman and one of the boy's all-time idols, who takes on the role of an older brother. Also in the clubhouse are Pete's boss, Lou Russo, a gruff but fair equipment manager who becomes a much-needed father figure; Carlos Tavares, a rookie who believes that Pete is his good luck charm, and Jose Marquez, the Empires' territorial head batboy. Pete is over the moon at being part of his favorite team but he must still balance life at home and life in the big leagues as he faces the moral dilemmas and curve balls that are thrown his way.",
