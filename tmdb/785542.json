After more than a decade of living life on the edge in London, where she both found and lost love, Rona – now 29 – attempts to come to terms with her troubled past. As she reconnects with the dramatic landscape where she grew up, memories of her traumatic childhood merge with more recent challenging events that have set her on the path to recovery.",
