Absolutely the coolest car ever created, KITT is equipped  with an \"AI\" (artificial intelligence) that is capable of hacking almost  any system. Its weapons systems match that of a jet fighter, and its  body is capable of actually transforming into other vehicles and using  sophisticated holographic imagery to elude villains.",
