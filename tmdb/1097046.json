  "overview": "Josie is a failed startup businesswoman, who is struggling with no permanent job. Ever since she saw her ex-boyfriend Seb escorting a politician and broke up with him three years ago, Josie remains single. Seb, on the other hand, becomes more sophisticated from earning handsomely through Sugar Dating. Josie learns about Seb’s success, prompting her to ask Seb to groom her for Sugar Dating. Once Josie gets a grasp on the work, she will be good at what she does and will not struggle financially anymore. At the same time, Seb’s feelings for her start coming back, but Josie now sees love differently. She thinks that love should only be transactional. It does not help that Josie can’t forget the time when Seb broke her heart.",
