  "overview": "It is quite revealing how complex the simple form is. Shot one to one, a girl is confronted with nothing more than her thoughts. In the period of watching her (while she is looking at you) her expressions and movements turn into a 'mirror' for the viewer to experience his or herself. The experience is solely emotive between you and her, and occurs in \"real\" time. (Stephen Dwoskin)",
