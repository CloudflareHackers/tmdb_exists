  "overview": "Settling into their new home—the rambling Victorian mansion at 1313 Mockingbird Lane— the Munster are quickly onto the mission at hand: to gently ease sweet little Eddie into the reality of his werewolf adolescence. The loving, supportive, run-of-the-mill family includes his mom Lily, the daughter of Dracula, his dad Herman, who brings new meaning to \"Frankenstein,\" and Grandpa! Of course, there's creepy cousin Marilyn, who's really the odd one because she's so completely normal.",
