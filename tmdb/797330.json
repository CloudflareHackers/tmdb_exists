  "overview": "Poochi lives in a small hut with his grandson Kumaresan, whose parents were killed in a caste riot a few years ago. Poochi has big dreams for Kumaresan and does all kinds of work to save money to get Kumaresan into a private school. When Vellaiyan, Poochi's beneficent but easily ruffled landlord instructs him to find a choice pig ('seththumaan'), Poochi and little Kumaresan get busy. However, once the pork and drink go down, tempers flare up, and Poochi must avoid getting caught up in the acerbic hostilities that consume his dominant caste overlords.",
