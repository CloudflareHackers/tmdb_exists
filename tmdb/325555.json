  "overview": "Ravi Kumar is clearly the black sheep of the Kumar family, and has been so for years. He is unemployed, uncouth, and gets into fist fights and trouble all the time. And then a man is killed, and the evidence points towards Ravi, he gets arrested. Although there were witnesses to this murder, no one comes forward to testify in favor of Ravi. The Kumar family are aware of Ravi's innocence, but watch helplessly as Ravi awaits his sentence, which may send him to the gallows, as now only a miracle can save Ravi. Written by rAjOo",
