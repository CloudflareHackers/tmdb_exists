  "overview": "Nesam and his soon-to-be ex-wife, a foreigner named Amy, head to his neglected ancestral castle to fulfill a divorce agreement. Amy has a hidden agenda involving Nesam’s father’s scientific secrets. Meanwhile, Nesam’s old lackeys, Dawood, Bala and Thangadurai also converge on the mansion with their own plans. When a hologram of Oviya enters the picture, and Amy unleashes a “Franken-Hulk” monster with Robo Shankar’s head, the film abandons all attempts at coherence.",
