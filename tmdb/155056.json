  "overview": "Campus Diaries is a coming-of-age drama of six students at Excel University. But this one is so-not-your-regular-college-drama because it goes beyond the routine frolic and friendship plots that quintessential youth dramas portray and tackles relevant yet lesser discussed issues like ragging, discrimination based on societal biases, one sided love stories, rampant drug abuse and toxic relationships that mould your personality and ready you to face the real world.",
