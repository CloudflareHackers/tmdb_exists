  "overview": "A elite restaurant divided by a single wall, workers toil in silence like slaves, while elites feast on “the gods’ favourite food.” One woman among the slaves adds a mysterious liquid to the eternal dish 'Ambrosia', triggering chaos among the guests. Emotions erupt, relationships collapse. As the illusion shatters, the enslaved rise and walk out. Ambrosia is a tale of rupture, rebellion, and reclaiming voice in a world built on silence.",
